# Dashcam Viewer App
My dashcam pumps out loads of 1 minute video clips and their mobile app sucks and is slow and uses Bluetooth. This app groups all the clips together to try and work out each individual trip and allows you to easily scan through them. This was made with a Garmin dashcam in mind but may well work on other formats, it is only dependent on file format otherwise it is platform agnostic. 

## Stack
Made in electron and otherwise just good old-fashioned HTML CSS and JS

## Run
Simply run `npm i` and `npm start` to get going.
